# Effects-of-Rainfall-on-Groundwater-level

## Problem Statement - 
Rainfall plays a vital role in influencing groundwater levels, particularly in regions where 
water demand, population growth, and climatic conditions exert pressure on groundwater 
resources. In India, where groundwater is a critical source of water supply for both agricultural 
and domestic use, understanding the relationship between rainfall and groundwater dynamics 
is essential. Rainfall variability can directly impact groundwater recharge, especially in 
regions with high water extraction rates. In areas with karst formations, groundwater responds 
rapidly to rainfall, and the interaction between rainfall and groundwater chemistry offers 
insights into hydrogeochemical processes. Furthermore, fluctuations in groundwater levels 
due to rainfall can affect water flow within the soil, potentially influencing slope stability. In 
regions like northern India, rainfall and groundwater over-extraction together contribute to 
significant changes in groundwater levels. For example, studies indicate that rainfall accounts 
for a smaller proportion of groundwater level changes compared to excessive groundwater 
exploitation. However, technologies such as rainwater harvesting and artificial recharge 
systems have the potential to mitigate groundwater depletion by capturing rainfall and 
stabilizing groundwater reserves. This interplay between rainfall, population-driven water 
use, and climate variability underscores the need to manage groundwater resources effectively 
in India.
Climate change affects groundwater in several direct and indirect ways. Major direct drivers 
are changes in precipitation, snowmelt, and evapotranspiration. It is known that the 
groundwater storage reduction caused by pumping could easily far exceed natural recharge. 
Groundwater in India is a vital resource crucial for sustaining various sectors, particularly 
agriculture. India heavily relies on groundwater to bridge seasonal gaps in surface water 
availability, especially during dry spells and erratic monsoon seasons. Relying significantly 
on groundwater, it contributes approximately 62% to irrigation, about 85% to rural water 
supply, and roughly 45% to urban water consumption.

## Objective of the Project -
Investigate the relationship between rainfall patterns and groundwater level fluctuations, 
particularly in karst regions, to understand how rainfall contributes to changes in 
groundwater availability. The goal of this project is to develop a predictive system that 
integrates machine learning (ML) techniques with real-time data inputs to forecast 
groundwater availability in response to changing environmental and usage patterns. 
Specifically, the project will focus on leveraging advanced ML algorithms, including 
Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and Linear Regression, to predict fluctuations 
in groundwater levels based on variables such as rainfall, groundwater. exploitation, 
population growth, and climate conditions. These machine learning models will be trained 
using historical data from the region, providing insights into the relationships between 
different variables and their collective influence on groundwater levels.
One of the key innovations of this project is the use of Explainable AI (XAI) methods, such 
as SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic 
Explanations), which will be integrated into the system to make the machine learning 
models more interpretable and transparent. These techniques will help stakeholders—such 
as policymakers, water resource managers, and local communities—understand the factors 
driving groundwater availability and make informed decisions based on the model's 
predictions. Explainability is a crucial feature, as it allows users to trust the system and gain 
insights into how specific factors, such as rainfall patterns or water usage, influence future 
groundwater levels.
